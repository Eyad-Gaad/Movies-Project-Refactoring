# Movies Project

A fully refactored and responsive movies web page built using **Tailwind CSS** and **modern JavaScript (ES6+)** practices. This project is an improved version of a previously pure CSS-based design, now enhanced with better code structure, modularity, and maintainability.

## 🔧 Refactoring Goals

- Replaced traditional CSS with **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first, responsive styling.
- Maintained original visual structure while improving performance and scalability.
- Introduced modern development standards and modular architecture.

## 🧩 Features

- **Responsive UI**: Fully mobile-friendly layout using Tailwind's responsive utilities.
- **Refactored Navbar**: JavaScript-based custom navigation logic built with ES6+ syntax.
  - Modular, component-based structure.
  - Supports native note creation for dynamic UI behavior.
- **Modular JavaScript**: Movie data is stored in a **separate module file** as an array of objects for scalability and reusability.
- **Strict File Organization**: All functionality is separated for clarity and single-responsibility adherence.
